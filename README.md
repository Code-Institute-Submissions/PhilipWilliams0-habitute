## User Experience (UX)

Hatitute design ensures that the shopping experience is fast, easy, and as personalised as possible. This is the best way to engage users and boost those all-important checkouts.

### User stories

<img src="assets/user-stories.png">

### Strategy

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily order products.

### Scope
The Habitute will have all the great design features of an eCommerce website. A straightforward navigation bar featuring main product categories prompts exploration. A service banner, placed under the header, immediately informs about shipping terms, a good practice for managing customer expectations.

### Structure
In designing the eCommerce website, I will conceptualise and arrange content and products for effective display and logic workflow. It should be easy to navigate the site on all screen sizes.

### Skeleton

I'm showing the mockup pages for the structure and how the site will appear on different screen pixels. The wireframes have been created using Balsamiq.

ERD diagram explains the database design for the Django backend. When you have a user profile, you can save your data there, and the next time you order, it will be preloaded; to the user connected to the website. You can also choose to override the default delivery address by changing it in the checkout process for a much quicker payment.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PhilipWilliams0/habitute)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Click [Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

### Virtual Environment

1. Set up a virtual environment with these commands in the terminal session:
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
>If you already have virtualenv installed from a different project, then this step is not needed. The pip command may differ per system this can be pip or pip3.
```
virtualenv env
```
>The needed command may differ to the IDE you are using, such as `python -m .venv venv ...` or `py manage.py` ...

Activate the .env with the command:
```
env\Scripts\activate
```
>This command may differ depending on your operating system, please check the Python documentation on creating an ENV.
2. Install all required django modules with the command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create a new env.py file at the base directory level and copy the following into the created env.py file:
```
import os

#Django
os.environ.setdefault( 'DEVELOPMENT', 'True')
os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', 'your_value')

#Stripe
os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', 'your_value')
os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'your_value')
```
Replace `your_value` with the values from your own created accounts for stripe and a [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/):
- [STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- [STRIPE_SECRET_KEY](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- [SECRET_KEY](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
4. Set up your database by running the following command in your terminal:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
Followed by:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
5. Now create a superuser to get access to the Django admin, use the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
6. Now we need to add the required data into the database in the following order by using the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
7. At this point you can start your server with the following command:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
If everything went correctly you should see something like this in the terminal:<br>


### Heroku
To create a live version of the website VSCode was used together with Heroku. This section assumes you have succeeded at running the application in your local environment first, as described above. To deploy the website with Heroku the following steps were made:
1. Log in or create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and create a new app by clicking the button.<br>

2. Give the app a unique name in all lowercase letters and set `Choose a region` to the one nearest to you (in this case Europ and 
postfly_jouw_online_drukkerij is already taken so think of another name), click on create app.<br>
3. On your app dashboard click `Deploy` and select `GitHub`, connect it to your GitHub respository. Don't click `Enable Automatic Deploys` yet.<br>

4. Click on the `Resources` tab and type `Heroku Postgres` in the `Add-ons` field, select the `Hobby Dev` option.
5. Click on `Settings` and then `Reveal Config Vars`. <br>
6. Fill in the values from your `env.py` file in your Heroku confic vars: <br>

| Key | Value | --- | ---
DATABASE_URL | `your_DATABASE_URL`SECRET_KEY | `your_SECRET_KEY`
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `your_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `your_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

The DATABASE_URL link which can be found in Heroku's Config Vars.<br>
7. Since the database on Heroku is created you need to adjust your `env.py` file, add:
```
os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', '<your postgres url grabbed from Heroku comes here>')
```
>Make sure not to share this link with anybody.
8. Now we need to migrate the new database connection with:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
Followed by:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
>Do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment if the system or IDE is rebooted.
9. Create a superuser to get access to the Django admin, use the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
10. Now we need to add the required data into the database in the following order by using the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
11. Install Heroku in the terminal, if you don't have that 
yet see how to do that [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and log in with the command: 
```
heroku login
```
12. Then use the command:
```
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app habitute
```
so that Heroku will not try to collect static during deployment.

13. After everything is set up as it should use the following commands to push to GitHub and Heroku:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Place your own commit message here"
git push
heroku git: remote -a your heroku git url
git push heroku main
```
You will then see something like this in your terminal:


14. If you want you can let the deployment to Heroku be automatically everytime you push to GitHub, on your app dashboard click `Deploy` and click `Enable Automatic Deploys`.
If you go to the `Activity` tab on your app dashboard you can see that there is abuild in progress, the details will look a bit like this:

Your app is running on Heroku now.

15. Log in to the admin panel by placing /admin behind your app name, for example for this one: https://habitute.herokuapp.com/admin
Using the superuser log in details log in.
>!!! If you don't see your email address you may need to attempt to log in first to force allauth to create it !!!

Go to `Email addresses` underneath `ACCOUNTS`, and mark `Primary` and `Verified` for the superuser email address, save the changes you made.

### Set up Amazon AWS

To follow the next steps make sure you have an Amazon AWS account and that you are logged in.

#### S3 Bucket

1. In the AWS Management Console search for S3, open it and click `Create bucket`<br>

2. Name your bucket to match your Heroku app name and select the region closest to you. Uncheck `Block all public access` and acknowledge that the bucket will be public.
Click `Create bucket`.

3. Click your newly made bucket and cick the `Properties` tab and turn on `Static website hosting`, just fill in a default value for the index and error document and click save.
4. Now click on the `Permissions` tab, with the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) fill in:
```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [

        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```
Save the changes. <br>

5. Go to `Bucket Policy` and click `Policy generator`, fill it out like this, but with your own arn.<br>

6. Copy the policy that you get and paste it in the `Bucket policy`, in tis case:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1643397465603",
    "Statement": [
        {

            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::habitute-project/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Make sure you add the /* with the resource key to allow acces to all resources in this bucket. Click save.<br>
7. Go to the `Access control list (ACL)` tab and set the list projects permission for everyone under the `Public Access` section.

#### IAM

1. In the AWS Management Console search for IAM, open it.
2. On the IAM dashboard click `User groups` and then `Create group`, name your group so it makes sense to you what it is. Click `Create group`.
3. On the menu left click `Policies` and then `Create Policy`.
4. Click on the `Json` tab and click `Import managed policy`, search for `S3` select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` one. Click import.
5. You just want to give permission to your bucket, so make sure you fill it out like this, but with your own arn! 
Click next untill you reach `ReviewPolicy`
6. Give it an name and a description and click `Create policy`.
7. You'll arrive back on the policy page, go to `User groups` in the menu on the left and click on manage-your-group-name.
8. Click `Attach policies` search for and select the policy you just created.
9. Click on `Users` in the menu on the left. Then click `Add users` name it after your app, in my case postfly-jouw-online-drukkerij-staticfiles-user, give programmatic access and select next. Add the user to the group you just created. Click through on next and then on create user.
10. Download the csv file you see there and save it!You need the secrect keys in there and once you've done this there is now way to retrieve it!!<br>

#### Connecting AWS to Django

This section assumes you have succeeded at running this application in your local environment first, deployed it to Heroku and set up AWS as described above.

1. Remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from your `Config Vars` on Heroku and add these values to it:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `your_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `your_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
USE_AWS | True

The values you'll find in the downloaded csv file.
Next time you deploy to Heroku, AWS will retrieve your static files and store them.

2. Go to S3, where you'll find a `static` folder with all your static files in it.
3. Click on `Create folder` and name it `media` click save and inside the media folder click `Upload`.
4. Click `Add files` and select the images that go with your products or in this case with the size.
5. Click next and under `Manage public permissions`, and choose `Grant public-read access`.
6. Then click`Upload`, you will see your files being uploaded.<br>

### Sending real emails with Gmail

1. Create or use an existing Gmail account.
2. Connect it to your application to the Gmail account. For more information see forexample this [site](https://dev.to/abderrahmanemustapha/how-to-send-email-with-django-and-gmail-in-production-the-right-way-24ab) and read `The Gmail part`.
3. Add the values to the Heroku Config Vars:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `your_EMAIL_HOST_PASS`
EMAIL_HOST_USER | `your_EMAIL_HOST_USER`

Everything should be ready to go now.
